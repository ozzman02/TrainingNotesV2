4. First Spring example

Spring IOC Container (IOC stands for Inversion Of Control): It handles the beans
The GoodMorningService is a dependency. We let Spring to take care of the dependencies.
We do not instantiate the GoodMorningService. Spring must have to do it for us.

@Component: Annotation that tells to Spring to handle a bean. In this case GoodMorningService is a bean.
@Autowired: Annotation that tells to Spring to inject the dependency.

package com.in28minutes.example.spring.business.examples;

@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(locations = { "/TestContext.xml" })
public class DependencyInjectionExamples {
	@Autowired
	GoodMorningService service;
	
	@Test
	public void dummyTest() {
		System.out.println(service.sayHi());
	}
}

@Component
class GoodMorningService {
	public String sayHi() {
		return "Hi"
	}
}
