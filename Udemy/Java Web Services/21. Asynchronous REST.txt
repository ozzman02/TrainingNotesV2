21. Asynchronous REST

Asynchronous communication is where client sends a restful request and the restful provider will not sent the response back
immediately. It will send a temporary response (HTTP 202) and the actual response will go back at a later point in 
time (HTTP 200 or error using 400 series)

Future vs CallBack

	Use future if you need control on the various web services client calls that you are making.
	Example: Data aggregation, you are calling multiple web services where you need to get all the data 
	before doing something else because you cannot proceed unless you have all the data comming from all
	the sources.
	
	Use CallBacks when you simple want a set of tasks to be executed.
