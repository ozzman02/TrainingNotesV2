3. XML and XML Schema definition Crash Course
	
	XML is mainly used in two places in software applications

		1. Configuration files
		2. Data Exchange

	We need a contract for the XML, that is defined in the XSD file (xml schema definition)

What is XML ? 

	Extensible Markup Language
	
	Advantages
	
		- Customer markup
		- Data and metadata
		- Well-Formedness
		- Validation

When to use?

	1. Configuration files
	2. Data Exchange
	3. Manipulate and present data	

What is XSD?

	XML Schema Definition: It defines the grammer or blueprint of the xml file.
	
	- Elements
	- Attributes
	- Namespaces
	- Order
	- Number of occurrences
	- Restrictions
	
	if an XML follows a XSD then is Valid. An XSD file works as a contract
	
Namespaces

	Uniquely identify the XML components
	
	Schema
		targetNamespace http://www.amazon.com/order or http://www.ebay.com/order
			
		prefix: xmlns:amz="http://www.amazon.com/order"
				xmlns:ebay="http://www.ebay.com/order"
		XML
			<order xmlns:amz="http://www.amazon.com/order">
				<amz:lineitem/>
				<amz:shippingaddress/>
			<order xmlns:ebay="http://www.ebay.com/order">
				<ebay:lineitem/>
				<ebay:shippingaddress/>
				
	What is the root element of a schema file? xsd:schema
	Which element in XML Schema can be used to restrict values? xsd:restriction
				
Use Case


Patient Billing Application --------> XML <-------- Patient Clinical Application

Patient
	Name
	Age
	DOB
	Email
	Gender
	Phone
	

Summary

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) allows:

	Custom elements
	Data and metadata
	Well-Formedness
	Valid

XSD (XML Schema Definition)

	Contract between XML provider and consumer
	Use elements define by W3C
	In built types
		Simple Types
		Complex Types
	Namespaces: Which uniquely qualifies the elements
