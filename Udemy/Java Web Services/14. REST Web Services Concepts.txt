14. REST Web Services Concepts

	Representational State Transfer
	
	Uniform interface and easy access to provide CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations
	
		HTTP Methods
		
			POST
			GET
			PUT
			Delete
		
		URI: /patients (Easy access)
		
		Multiple formats
		
			XML
			JSON
			
		Statelessness: Allows scalability
		
Advantages

	Single interface
	Easy to access
	Interoperable & Multiple Formats
	Stateless: State will be maintain in the client. (browser)
	Scalability
	
When to use

	No formal contract
	Multiple data formats
	Bandwidth and Memory
	No overhead
	Stateless
	Caching
	Existing logic can be exposed easily
	
Which of the following is not a good candidate for using REST ?

	Formal Contract needs to be defined
	
Desing Steps

	Identify the resources
	Create URIs to access those resources
	Assign HTTO methods
	Choose the data format
