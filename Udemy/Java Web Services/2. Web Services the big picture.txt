2. Web Services the Big Picture

What is a web service?

	Web services are Consumer - Provider applications that communicate on the network through the HTTP protocol and exchange messages or data as
	XML (eXtensible Markup Language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), etc.

	Advantages:
	
	- They provide Interoperability between software applications meaning that software applications developed in different
		programming languages can communicate with each other. 

	- Loosely Coupled: 

	- Extensibility

	- Mashups
	
	
Types

	- SOAP: Message exchange using XML and HTTP POST

	- RESTFul: Multiple data formats, multiple HTTP Methods

Java Web Service Standards

	- JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web Services): Standard for SOAP based services
	- JAX-RS (Java API for RESTFul Web Services): Standard for RESTFul webservices

SOA and Web Services

	SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) is a collection of architectural principles to design and implement software applications through services 
		that are loosely coupled.
	
	SOA is mantained by W3C and OASIS
	
	SOA is a set of principles and web services the way to implement them.


	Consumer - Provider roles

		Definition of service according to SOA: Implementation of business logic that operates independant of the state of other service.
		They will be able to communicate as long as the interface or the contract between them remains the same.

		SOAP --------> WSDL file
		REST --------> WADL file

		Format: XML

		Advantages

			- Platform independant
			- Focus to developer roles
			- Loosely coupled
			- Reusability
			- Cost reduction
			- Scalability
			- Availability

		Ancestors
		
			- CORBA
			- JAVA RMI
			- DCOM
			- MESSAGING
