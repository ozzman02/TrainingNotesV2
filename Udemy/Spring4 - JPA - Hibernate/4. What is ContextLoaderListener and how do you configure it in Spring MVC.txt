What is ContextLoaderListener and how do you configure it in Spring MVC?

	- ContextLoaderListener is responsible for creating a root application context in Java Enterprise Applications inside ServletContext.
	- Developers can use different controller and view layers (for example Struts, JSF or Spring MVC can be used) however Spring Framework
		will be responsible for managing service layers or components defined in ContextLoaderListener configuration files.
	- You can set different configuration XML files in web.xml
