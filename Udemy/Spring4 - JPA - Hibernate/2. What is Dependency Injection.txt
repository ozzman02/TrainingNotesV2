What is Dependency Injection?

	- This is also called as IOC (Inversion Of Control Principle)
	- It is a software design pattern which is really useful for designing loosely coupled software components.
	- You will have more plug-gable and testable code and objects.
	- It is easy to reuse your code in other applications.
	- The dependencies won't be hard coded inside all Java objects/classes instead they will be defined in
		XML configuration files or configuration classes (Java Config)
	- Spring Container is responsible for injecting dependencies of objects.
	- There are two types of Dependency Injection in Spring Framework, Setter Injection and Constructor Injection.
