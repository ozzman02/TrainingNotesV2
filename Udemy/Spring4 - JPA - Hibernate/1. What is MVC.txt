What is MVC?

	- MVC stands for Model View Controller
	- It is a desing pattern used in WEB based JAVA Enterprise Applications.
	- MVC pattern is also implemented in other WEB frameworks as well for separating the model layer from the view layer.
		By doing that UI programmers and back end developers can work together.
	- Model Layer includes business specific logic.
	- View Layer is responsible for rendering (displaying) model objects inside the user interface using different view technologies
		(JSP, Facelets or Velocity) (Browser)
	- Controller receives user inputs and calls model objects based on handler mappings and pass model objects to views in order to 
		display output inside the view layer.
