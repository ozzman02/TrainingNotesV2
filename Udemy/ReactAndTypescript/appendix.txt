Typescript 

Overview
	
	- Help us catch errors during development.
	- Uses type annotations to analyze our code.
	- Only active during development.
	- Does not provide any performance optimization.
	
Syntax + Features vs Design Patterns with TS
	
	Syntax + Features
		
		- What is an interface?
		- What is the syntax for defining an interface?
	
		1. Understanding basic types in TS.
		
			Types:
				
				Primitive Types:
					
					- number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null
					
				Object Types:
					
					- functions, arrays, classes, objects
			
				
				
		2. Function typing + annotations.
			
			Type Annotations: Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to.
			
			Type inference: Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to.
			
			
		
		3. Type definition files.
		4. Arrays in TS.
		5. Modules systems.
		6. Classes + Refresher on OOP.
		
	
	Design Patterns with TS
		
		- How do we use interfaces to write reusable code?

Environment

	Install Typescript
	
		npm install -g typescript ts-node
		
		tsc --help
	
	To use the latest versions of axios, we need to install the @types/node library:
	
		npm install --save-dev @types/node
	
	Also, Typescript 5.6 introduced some breaking changes a few weeks ago related to imports. ts-node is currently not in sync with this since it has not seen an update since 2023.

	To address this, please install the latest 5.5 version of TypeScrip
	
		npm uninstall -g typescript
	
		npm install -g typescript@5.5
	

First App

	- mkdir fetchjson
	
	- cd fetchjson
	
	- npm init -y
	
	- npm install axios
	
	- create an index.ts file and write some code
	
	- compile the code => tsc .\index.ts
	
	- index.js file will be created
	
	- execute => node index.js
	
	- response =>	{ userId: 1, id: 1, title: 'delectus aut autem', completed: false }
	
	- ts-node combines tsc .\index.ts and node index.js commands
	
	- ts-node index.ts => { userId: 1, id: 1, title: 'delectus aut autem', completed: false }
