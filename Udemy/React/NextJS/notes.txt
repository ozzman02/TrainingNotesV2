Create a NextJS project
	
	npx create-next-app@latest
	
Two approaches for building NextJS Apps

	Pages Router.
		
		- Has been around for many years.
		
		- Very stable.
		
		- Used in many existing NextJS projects.
		
		- Allows you to build feature-rich fullstack apps with React.
	
	App Router
		
		- Introduced with NextJS 13
		
		- Marked as stable but still relatively new and partially buggy.
		
		- Supports modern Next and React features (fullstack React apps)
		
		- The future on NextJS.
		
		
	
Run the app

	npm run dev
	
Vanilla React Apps Render on the Client
	
	Server side only returns one single html file which contains the client side JS code.
	
	Client side: The visible content is generated and rendered on the client side by the client side React code.
	
	React is a client side Javascript library. It runs in the browser. It edits and manipulates the page in the browser.
	
	In React, a page update is performed via client side. The page is not reloaded or re rendered on the server.
	
NextJS renders pages on the server

	Page HTML content is rendered on the server and sent to the client.
	
	With NextJS you no longer have a client side application, you have a full stack application.
