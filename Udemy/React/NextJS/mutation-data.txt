Multiple Data Mutation Strategies

Option 1
	
	Standalone Backend
		
		A separate backend receives requests from the NextJS app and stores / mutates all data.
		
	Separate Server	 ---------> NextJS App
		
	  POST, PATCH
	  
	Problem: Unnecessary complexity, unnecessary extra server.
	
Option 2

	Integrated NextJS App
		
		The NextJS app itself contains the data mutation code and reaches out directly to the data stores.
		
	NextJS App	
		
		Renders pages and handles for submissions / data mutation
		
	Advantage:
		
		Reduced complexity, single codebase and server.
