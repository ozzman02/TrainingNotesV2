In Next.js, both nested and dynamic routes play crucial roles in structuring an application's navigation, 
but they serve different purposes and are implemented differently.

Nested Routes
	
	Nested routes are created through a hierarchical folder structure within the app directory. 
	Each folder represents a route segment, and files within those folders (like page.js) define the content for that route.
	
	For example, a file structure like this:
		
		app/
		  dashboard/
			settings/
			  page.js
			users/
			  page.js
			page.js
			
	Will result in the following routes:
	
		/dashboard (content from app/dashboard/page.js)
		/dashboard/settings (content from app/dashboard/settings/page.js)
		/dashboard/users (content from app/dashboard/users/page.js)
		
Dynamic Routes
	
	Dynamic routes use bracket syntax ([]) in the file or folder name to create routes with dynamic segments. 
	These segments can be populated with values at runtime.
	
	For example, a file structure like this:
		
		app/
		  blog/
			[slug]/
			  page.js
			  
	Will match routes like 
		
		/blog/my-first-post or /blog/another-article. 
	
	The slug value will be accessible within the page.js component, allowing you to fetch and display the corresponding content.
	
Catch All Routes

	A catch-all route in Next.js is used to match any number of URL segments for a specific route. 
	
	This is especially useful when creating dynamic routes that can handle paths with varying depths, such as 
	
		/products/category/shoes or /posts/2024/november.
		
	1. Creating a Catch-All Route
		
		To create a catch-all route, use square brackets [] with three dots ... inside the pages directory. For example:
		
		/pages/[...slug].js
		
	2. Accessing the Catch-All Segments
	
		import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

		const CatchAllRoute = () => {
		  const router = useRouter();
		  const { slug } = router.query;

		  return (
			<div>
			  <h1>Catch-All Route</h1>
			  <p>Matched Path: {slug ? slug.join('/') : 'Home'}</p>
			</div>
		  );
		};

		export default CatchAllRoute;
		
		
		If the user visits /products/category/shoes, slug will be ['products', 'category', 'shoes']

	3. Practical Use Cases
	
		Blog Posts: /blog/[...slug] for URLs like /blog/2024/november/nextjs-tips.

		Product Categories: /products/[[...slug]] for /products or /products/category/shoes.

		Documentation: /docs/[...slug] for /docs/getting-started/setup.
	
	
	
Parallel Routes
	
	Next.js Parallel Routes allow for the simultaneous rendering of multiple pages within the same layout, enabling dynamic  and interactive user interfaces. 
	
	This is achieved through the use of named slots, which define distinct sections within a layout where different routes can be rendered. 
	
	Key Concepts:
	
		Slots:
		
			Parallel routes are defined using named slots within a layout, indicated by the @ symbol in the file system (e.g., @analytics, @team). 

		Simultaneous Rendering:
		
			Multiple pages can be rendered within the same layout concurrently, allowing for dynamic sections like dashboards or feeds to update independently. 

		Independent Loading and Error States:
		
			Each parallel route can have its own loading and error states, allowing for a more granular and user-friendly experience. 

		Conditional Rendering:

			Parallel Routes can be used to conditionally render content based on user actions, authentication status, or other criteria. 

		default.tsx:
			
			A default.tsx file can be used to provide a fallback view for unmatched routes, ensuring a consistent user experience. 
	
	Use Cases:
		
		Dashboards:
		
			Rendering different sections of a dashboard (e.g., team members, analytics) simultaneously. 
		
		Feeds:
		
			Displaying multiple streams of content (e.g., news feed, social feed) in the same view. 
		
		Modals:
			
			Creating modals that can be linked directly using URLs and managed independently. 
		
		Tabs:
			
			Implementing tab navigation with different pages within the same layout, maintaining the same context. 
			
	Example
		
		app/dashboard/page.tsx  // Layout (parent)
		// ...

		app/dashboard/(@analytics)/page.tsx  // Slot 1 (analytics)
		// ...

		app/dashboard/(@team)/page.tsx   // Slot 2 (team)
		// ...

		app/dashboard/(default)/page.tsx // Fallback for unmatched routes
		// ...
	
Intercepting routes
	
	Intercepting routes in Next.js allow you to display content from one route within the context of another, like a modal window or an overlay, 
	without actually changing the user's URL or navigating to a new page.
	
	What they do:

		Intercepting routes allow you to intercept a route before it's fully rendered and instead render content from a different part of your application. 

	Why use them:
	
		This is useful for scenarios like displaying a login modal without changing the user's URL, showing a product detail overlay when 
		a user clicks on a product in a catalog, or implementing a notification system that appears on top of the current page. 

	How they work:

		You create a special route within the main route structure that acts as an interceptor. When a user navigates to the main route, 
		the intercepting route is triggered, and the content it renders is displayed on top of the main route's content. 

	Example:
	
		Imagine a user browsing a product catalog. When they click on a product, instead of navigating to a new page with the product details, 
		the intercepting route displays the product details in a modal window within the existing catalog layout. 
	
	Benefits:
	
		Intercepting routes improve user experience by providing a more fluid and less disruptive navigation flow. 
		They also increase application flexibility by allowing you to reuse components and content across different routes.
	
	app/
	├── feed/
	│   ├── page.tsx
	│   └── (.)photo/[id]/
	│       └── page.tsx
	
	
	How it Works:
	
		When you click on Link in /feed/page.tsx with href="/feed/photo/123", the route /feed/photo/123 is intercepted.
		
		Next.js will load the page.tsx inside /feed/(.)photo/[id] instead of the /photo/[id]/page.tsx.
		
		The /feed/(.)photo/[id]/page.tsx renders a modal or a component within the feed's layout.

		When you click the "Close Modal" button or the Link to /photo/123 in /feed/page.tsx, the interception stops, and you navigate to /photo/[id]/page.tsx.

		If you navigate to "/photo/123" directly in your browser or by sharing the URL, you'll see the full-page photo route, not the modal. 
		
Route Groups
	
	Route groups in Next.js enable the organization of route segments without affecting the URL structure. 
	They are created by wrapping a folder name in parentheses, like (groupName). This convention tells Next.js to treat the folder 
	solely for organizational purposes, excluding it from the route's URL path.

	Route groups serve two primary functions:
	
	Organization:
		
		They help structure projects by grouping related routes. For instance, routes can be grouped by site section 
		(e.g., (marketing), (admin)), by intent (e.g., (auth)), or by team.

	Nested Layouts:
	
		Route groups facilitate applying different layouts to specific subsets of routes within a common segment, 
		including the creation of multiple root layouts.
	
	It's important to note that route group names are purely for organization and do not impact the URL path. 
	
	Routes within different route groups should not resolve to the same URL path to avoid conflicts. 
	
	Additionally, navigating between different root layouts (defined using route groups) will trigger a full page load, as opposed to a client-side navigation.
