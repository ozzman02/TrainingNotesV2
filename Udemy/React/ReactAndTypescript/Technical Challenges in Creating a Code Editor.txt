Technical Challenges in Creating a Code Editor

1. Parsing & Syntax Highlighting

	The editor needs to recognize keywords, functions, variables, and other elements in different programming languages.

	Libraries like Monaco Editor (used in VS Code) or CodeMirror help with this.
	
2. Real-Time Code Execution

	If you're allowing users to run their code, you need a way to execute it safely (e.g., sandboxing it in an iframe).

	Preventing security vulnerabilities (like infinite loops or access to system functions) is crucial.
	
3. Transpiling & Bundling Code on the Fly

	Since browsers don’t support TypeScript or modern JS features directly, you need transpilers like Babel or Esbuild.

	You also have to resolve module imports dynamically (which your Esbuild setup handles well!).
	
4. Handling Dependencies & Imports

	Unlike Node.js, browsers don’t have a built-in module system.

	You use plugins (like unpkgPathPlugin) to fetch modules dynamically from CDNs.
	
5. State Management & Performance Optimization

	React is great for managing state (like the code input and output).

	You need efficient ways to update the UI without unnecessary re-renders.
