Problem

	1. Multiple classes require the same object instance.
	2. There can only be one object for the entire application.
	3. It must be guaranteed that there is only one object.

Example
	
	One File System, Window Manager
	
When to apply Singleton Pattern

	1. Only one instance of class required.
	2. Must be one access point.
	3. Need to manage object instances
	
Benefits

	1. Controlled access to one instance
	2. Reduce name space -----> avoid global variables
	3. The ability to subclass the singleton class.
