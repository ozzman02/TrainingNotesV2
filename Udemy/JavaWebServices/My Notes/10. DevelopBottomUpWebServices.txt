Develop Bottom up Web Services (Java first)

    We should use this approach where the code is already there (legacy application exists) and 
    we want to expose that legacy service as a web service so it can be exposed to other consumers

    Steps

        1. Create the project
        2. Create the endpoint
        3. Mark with JAXB annotations
        4. Mark with JAX-WS annotations
        5. Create the Config class
        6. Run the application
