Syntax Language
	
	Browser language other than English
		
		Set(gblLanguage; "en");;
		
		
	Browser language set to English
		
		Set(gblLanguage, "en");
		
	Recommendation: Change the browser language to English/
	
UI Language
	
	Settings -> PowerApps Settings -> Use Brower Language.
	
	
Connections
	
	- Instances of a connector in use.
	- Enable data flow between your app and datasource.
	- Securely store credentials for data access.
	
	
Forms

	Connect a button to an Edit Form
	
		OnSelect 
			
			SubmitForm(FormName)
	

	Get the value of a dropdown	
			
		DropDownName.Selected.Value
	
	NewForm(FormName)
	
Galleries
	
	Connect the galllery to a data source.
	
	Refer to an item of the gallery with ThisItem.DataSourceFieldName
	
	Items Property
		
		Usually it points to the datasource you are connecting to.
		
	Filtering data
	
		AND condition
		
			Items -> Filter(Employees, Department = "IT", Department = "Finance")
		
		OR condition
		
			Items -> Filter(Employees, Department = "IT" || Department = "Finance")
			
			Items -> Filter(Employees, Department = "IT" OR Department = "Finance")
			
			
		Using a text field to search for keyword
		
			Here we are searching by a department
			
				Items -> Filter(Employees, StartsWith(Department, txtSearchBar.Text))
			
			Here we are searching by display name and department
				
				Items -> Filter(Employees, StartsWith(Department, txtSearchBar.Text) OR StartsWith('Display Name', txtSearchBar.Text))
			
			Using Search function
				
				Items -> Search(Employees, txtSearchBar.Text, Department, FirstName, Surname)
				
				
			Hints
				
				Where to use Search and Filter
				
					Search will give delegation warning. In our example we are connecting to a sharepoint which is NOT delegable.
					This warning means that some searcheable columns will not work correctly on large datasets.
				
				
				Filter is suitable to work on large datasets sharepoint list.
				
	Show a datasource field value in the gallery

		Text -> ThisItem.DatasourceField
				
	Select an item and show it in a different control
	
		Label
			
			Text -> Gallery.Selected.Q
				
				
Delegation
	
	Helps PowerApps work with large sets of data without getting overwhelmed.
	
	- Improves app performance.
	- Handles data sets beyond the default 500/2000 item limit.
	- Reduces strain on the app and user's device.
	
	
	Depending on the datasource Microsoft provides a list of delegable and non delegable functions
	
		Example
			
			Not delegable for sharepoint
				
				Filter(..., IsBlank(CustomerId))
				
			Delegable for sharepoint
				
				Filter(..., CustomerId = Blank())
				
			These formulas are not equivalent because the second formula won't treat the empty string ("") as empty.
			On Sharepoint, this approach will work for the equals operator ("=") but not the operator for not equals ("<>")
			
Navigation
	
	Navigate('Form Screen', ScreenTransition.Cover)
	
Custom Form & Gallery

	On a text field (In this case First Name) set the default property
	
		default -> GalleryEmployees.Selected.'First Name'
	
	Surname	
		
		default -> GalleryEmployees.Selected.Surname
		
		
		
	SubmitButton

		onSelect -> 
			
			Patch(
				Employees, 
				Defaults(Employees), 
				{
					Department: Dropdown2.Selected.Value, 
					'First Name': txtFirstName.Text, 
					'Display Name': txtDisplayName.Text
					Surname: txtSurname.Text,
					Birthday: dateBirthDay.SelectedDate
				}
			);
			
			If(
				IsEmpty(Errors(Employees)),
				Notify("Successfully saved", NotificationType.Success, 2000);
				Navigate('Form Screen'),
				
				Notify("There was an error saving the form. Please contact your administrator", NotificationType.Error, 2000)
			)
			
			
			
		Error with title field. Title field is required but it's some kind of special. We can change it as not required.
		
			ListSettings
				
				Click on Title and change it as not required (Required that this column contains information)
				
			We can also hide the column in column settings from the list view.
			
			If you change something in the datasource go and refresh.
			
			After refresh, copy and paste the code again.
		
		
		
Hide Or Show based on values

	Use a button to change a variable that you can use for reference later.
	
		Button1 -> OnSelect -> Set(gblShowAnswer, true)
		Button2 -> OnSelect -> Set(gblShowAnswer, false)
	
	Use the visible property (on a label for example..) and reference the variable that was created.
	
		Label -> Visible -> gblShowAnswer
		
	Button1 -> Visible -> !gblShowAnswer
