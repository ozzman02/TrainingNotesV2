IAM it's universal, consistent across the platform.

Root account is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. It has complete access rights.

By default a new user does not have permissions.

New users are assigned Access Key Id and Secret Access Key when first created. They are not the same as user and password and 
you can't used them to login to the console. You can use them to access AWS from command line and APIs. You will have the option
to download them only once. If you lose them they have to be regenerated.

Always setupt MFA on the root account.

You can create and customize your password rotation policies.
