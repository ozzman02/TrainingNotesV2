	worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management 
	complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk 
	automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. 
	Elastic Beanstalk uses highly reliable and scalable services that are available in the AWS Free Usage Tier.
