13. VPC Virtual Private Cloud

	What is a VPC?
	
		Think of a VPC as a virtual data centre in the cloud.
		
		Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud where you can launch
		AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment,
		including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and 
		network gateways.
		
		You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. For example,
		you can create a public-facing subnet for your webservers that has access to the internet and place your
		backend systems such a databases or application servers in a private facing subnet with no Internet access.
		You can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists to
		help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.
		Additionally, you can create a Hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate
		datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS Cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter.
		
	What can i do with a VPC
	
	- Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing.
	- Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet.
	- Configure route tables between subnets
	- Create internet gateways and attach them to subnets (or not)
	- Much better security control over your AWS resources.
		- Instance security groups.
		- Subnet network access control lists (ACLS)
		
	Default VPC vs Custom VPC
	
		- Default VPC is user friendly, allowing you to immediately deploy instances.
		- All subnets in default VPC have an internet gateway attached.
		- Each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP address.
		- If you delete the default VPC the only way to get it back is to contact AWS.
		
	VPC Peering
	
		- Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses.
		- Instances behave as if they were on the same private network.
		- You can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPCs in the same account.
		- Peering is a star configuration, ie 1 central VPC peers with 4 others.
		
	VPC Restrictions

		- 5 Elastic IP addresses
		- 5 Internet Gateways
		- 5 VPCs per region (can be increased upon request)
		- 50 VPN connections per region
		- 50 Customer gateways per region
		- 200 Route tables per region
		- 100 Security Groups per VPC
		- 50 Rules per Security group
		
		How many internet gateways can I attach to my custom VPC? 1
		
		CIDR block: Classless Inter-Domain Routing
		
		Even if you have ec2 instances inside your public subnet it does not mean that they have Internet access by default.
		You need to attach a public ip address or an elastic load balancer.
		
		Each ec2 instance performs source/destination checks by default. That means the instance must be the source/destination of any traffic it sends or receives.
		The NAT instance must be able to send or receive traffic when the source/destination is not itself. You need to disable source/destination checks on the 
		NAT instance.
		
		
	VPC - ACLs
	
		They act like a firewall, allowing you to put down network rules accross entire subnets rather than doing it through security groups.
		Overrules what the rules are in a security group.
	
		When you create your VPC is comes with a modifiable ACL that by default allows all inbound/outbound.
		
		Each subnet must be associated with a Network Access Control List (ACL). If you do not explicitly associate a subnet with an ACL it is going to be
		associated with the default network ACL. 
		
		When you add rules they are evaluated the "lowest number first"
		
		Can you have multiple ACL for a subnet? No
