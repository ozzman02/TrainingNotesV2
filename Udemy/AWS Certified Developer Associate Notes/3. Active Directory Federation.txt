Active Directory Federation

1. The flow is initiated when a user (let's call him Bob) browses to the ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services) sample site
	(https://Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name.Here/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx) inside his domain. When you install
	ADFS, you get a new virtual directory named adfs for your default website, which includes this page.
	
2. The sign-on page authenticates Bob against AD. Depending on the browser Bob is using, he might be prompted for his AD user name and password.

3. Bob's browser receives a SAML (Secure Assertive Markup Language) assertion in the form of an authentication response from ADFS.

4. Bob's browser posts the SAML assertion to the AWS sign-in endpoint for SAML (https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml). Behind the scenes, sign-in uses
	the AssumeRoleWithSAML API to request a temporary security credentials and then constructs a sign-in URL for the AWS Management Console.

5. Bob's browser receives the sign-in URL and it's redirected to the console.

From Bob's perspective, the process happens transparently, He starts at an internal website and ends up at the AWS Management Console, without ever 
having to supply any AWS credentials.	


Can you authenticate with Active Directory? Yes using SAML
Do you get security credentials first? No, Authenticate against Active Directory first and then you get credentials.
