6. Databases Overview  & Concepts

Introduction

	- Relational (OLTP - Online Transaction Processing)
		RDS: MySql, SQL, Postgres, Oracle, Aurora

	- Non Relational Databases (NoSQL)
		DynamoDB
	
	- Data Warehousing Databases (OLAP - Online Analytics Programming)
		RedShift
	
ElastiCache
	
	Web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate and scale an in memory cache in the cloud.
	The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve
	information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower
	disk-based databases. ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
		
		- Memcached
		- Redis
	
	A very common use is to use ElastiCache is in sessions variables
	

NoSQL - Relational

	Collection 		= Table
	Document 		= Row
	Key Value Pair  = Fields

DynamoDB vs MongoDB

	DynamoDB does not allow you to have embedded data structures, MongoDB does.

Data Warehousing
	
	Used for business intelligence. Tools like Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server Reporting Services, Oracle Hyperion, SAP NetWeaver.
	Data Warehousing databases use different type of architecture both from a database perspective and infrastructure layer.
	
OLTP vs OLAP

	OLAP differs from OLAP in terms of the types of queries run.
	
	OLTP is for small amount of data.
	OLAP is more used for management, is not used frequently run at the end of every day, every month, every quarter. Large amount of data.
	
Summary

RDS is for OLTP
DynamoDB is a NoSQL
RedShift is for OLAP
ElastiCache is for in memory caching
