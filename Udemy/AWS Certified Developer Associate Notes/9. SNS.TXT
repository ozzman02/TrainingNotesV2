9. SNS Simple Notification Service

Is a web service that makes it easy to setup, operate and send notifications from the cloud. It provides developers with a highly scalable, flexible
and cost effective capability to publish messages from an application and immediately deliver them to subscribers or other applications.

SNS follows the publish - subscribe (pub-sub) messaging paradigm, with notifications being delivered to clients using a push mechanism that eliminates
the need to periodically check or poll for new information and updates. With simple APIs requiring minimal up front development effort, no 
maintenance or management overhead and pay as you go pricing, Amazon SNS gives developers an easy mechanism to incorporate a powerful notification
system with their applications.

It is opposed to SQS because SNS "pushes" and SQS "pulls"

Besides pushing cloud notifications directly to mobile devices, Amazon SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS text messages or email, to Amazon Simple Queue
Service (SQS) queues or to any HTTP endpoint.

To prevent messages from being lost all messages published to Amazon SNS are stored redundantly across multiple availability zones.

Data type is JSON

SNS Topics

SNS allows you to group multiple recipients using topics. A topic is an access point for allowing recipients to dynamically subscribe for identical
copies of the same notification. One topic can support deliveries to multiple endpoint types -- for example, you can group together iOS, Android and SMS
recipients. When you publish once to a topic, SNS delivers appropiately formatted copies of your message to each subscriber.
