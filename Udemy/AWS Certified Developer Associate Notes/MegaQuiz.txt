- Amazon S3 buckets in the US Standard region do not provide eventual consistency. False

- In Identity Access Management, using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0) you can give 
your federated users single sign-on (SSO) access to the AWS Management Console.

	True
	
- You can have 1 subnet stretched across multiple availability zones.

	False
	
- When you create new subnets within a custom VPC, by default they can communicate with each other, across availability zones.

	True
	
- It is possible to transfer a reserved instance from one Availability Zone to another.
	
	True

- You have an EC2 instance which needs to find out both its private IP address and its public IP address. To do this you need to;

	Retrieve the instance Metadata from http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
	
- To retrieve instance metadata or userdata you will need to use the following IP Address;
	 
	http://169.254.169.254
	
- Amazon S3 buckets in all other regions (other than US Standard) provide read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects.

	True

- Amazon S3 buckets in all other regions (other than US Standard) do not provide eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES.

	False

- Amazon S3 provides;

	Unlimited Storage
	
- In order to enable encryption at rest using EC2 and Elastic Block Store you need to

	Configure encryption when creating the EBS volume
	Correct - http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/05/21/Amazon-EBS-encryption-now-available/
	
- You can select a specific Availability Zone in which to place your DynamoDB Table
 
	False
	
- You run a website which hosts videos and you have two types of members, premium fee paying members and free members. 
All videos uploaded by both your premium members and free members are processed by a fleet of EC2 instances which will poll SQS as 
videos are uploaded. However you need to ensure that your premium fee paying members videos have a higher priority than your free members. 
How do you design SQS?

	Create two SQS queues, one for premium members and one for free members. Program your EC2 fleet to poll the premium queue first and if 
	empty, to then poll your free members SQS queue 
	
- You can have multiple SSL certificates (for multiple domain names) on a single Elastic Load Balancer.

	True
	
- What is the default region for all SDKs?

	US-EAST-1

- Which of the following languages is NOT supported by the AWS SDK?

	C++
	
- Which of these AWS services do not use key value pairs?

	Route53

- After successfully uploading a file to S3, what HTTP response code should you expect to see?

	HTTP 200
	
- What is the default encryption used on S3?

	Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256
	
- In the shared responsibility model, what is AWS's responsibility?

	Restricting access to the data centres, proper destruction of decommissioned disks, patching of firmware for the hardware on which your AWS resources reside.
	
- If you make an AMI public, this AMI is immediately available across all regions, by default.

	False

- With EC2 you can have 2 types of storage, EBS storage or Instance Store. EBS is persistent and if an EC2 instance is stopped with an EBS volume attached, there will be no data lost. 
Instance Store is ephemeral and if the EC2 instance is stopped, all data will be lost.

	True
	
- You are designing an application which needs to locate the public IP address on the EC2 instance on which it is stored. What do you do?

	Get the instance's META data by visiting http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

- How many internet gateways can I attach to my custom VPC

	1

- You have 2 EC2 instances which sit in a custom VPC in a public subnet. These instances are able to receive internet traffic. 
	You add a 3rd instance to the subnet, but it cannot access the internet. What should you do?
	
	Add an elastic IP address to the new instance.
	
- You have added a NAT EC2 instance to your VPC, but your EC2 instances in the private subnet still cannot access the internet. What should you do with the NAT?

	Disable source/destination checks on the NAT instance
	
- You create a static hosting website in a bucket called "acloudguru" in Sydney using S3. What would the new URL End Point be?

	http://acloudguru.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com
	
- You are hosting a static website in an S3 bucket which uses Java script to reference assets in another S3 bucket. 
For some reason however these assets are not displaying when users browse to the site. What could be the problem?

	You haven't enabled Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the bucket where the assets are stored.
	
- There is a hard limit on how much data you can store on S3.

	False
	
- What is the largest size file you can transfer to S3 using a PUT operation?

	5gb

- You have a motion sensor which writes 300 items of data every 30 seconds. Each item consists of 5kb. 
	Your application uses eventually consistent reads. What should you set the read throughput to?

	Correct! 300 / 30 = 10 items per second. 5kb rounded to nearest 4kb chunk is 8kb. 8 / 4 = 2. 
	This means you need 2 reads per item. 2 x 10 = 20 reads per second. As the reads are EVENTUALLY consistent, 20 / 2 = 10.
