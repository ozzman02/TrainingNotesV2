S3

S3 provides developers and IT Teams with secure, durable, high-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface
to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

- Object based i.e allows you to upload files
- Files can be from 1 byte to 5TB
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in buckets
- Buckets have a unique namespace for each region (eg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ACLOUDGURU/)
- Amazon guarantees 99.99% availability for the S3 platform.
- Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability for S3 information
- Can have metadata	(key value pairs) on each storage
- Lifecycle management
- Versioning
- Encryption

Storage Types

- Standard S3, 99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability
- Reduce Redundancy Storage (RRS) - Still has 99.99% availability but only 99.99% durability over a given year
- Only use RRS for replaceable data. For example if you have 10,0000 files you could expect to lose 100 files over a year as opposed to 0.00001 file with standard
	
Glacier

Extremely low cost storage service for data archival. Amazon Glacier stores data for as little as $0.01 per gigabyte
per month, and is optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and for which retrieval times of 3 to 5 hours are 
suitable.

S3 Versioning

- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
- Great backup tool
- Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended.
- You pay for each version of the file that you are storing.
- The only way to disable it is deleting the bucket and all versions within the bucket.
- Versioning allows you to retrieve, preserve and restore every version of every object stored in the bucket.
- To restore a file you need to delete the "delete marker"
- To delete a file permanently you have to delete the "delete marker" and all versions of the file


S3 Lifecycle Management

- Can be used in conjunction with versioning
- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions
- Following actions are allowed in conjunction with or without versioning;
	Archive only
	Permanent delete only
	Archive and then permanently delete

S3 Encryption

You can upload/download your data to S3 via SSL Encrypted End Points and S3 can automatically encrypt your data at rest.
S3 gives you the choice of managing your keys through AWS Key Management Service (KMS), having Amazon S3 manage them for
you, or providing your own keys.


S3 Encryption Exam Tips

- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 Encryption
- Encryption can be either Server Side or Client Side
	Server side
		Amazon S3 Managed Keys
		AWS KMS-Managed Keys
		Customer Provided Keys
	Client Side
		
		
S3 Security

- All buckets are private by default
- Allows access control lists (an individual user, can only have access to 1 buckets and only have read only access)
- Integrates with IAM (using roles for example allows users to have access S3 buckets by roles)
- All endpoints are encrypted by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

S3 Functionality

- Static Websites can be hosted on S3. No need for webservers, you can just upload a static .html to an s3 bucket and take advantage
of AWS S3's durability and High Availability

- Integrates with Cloud Front CDN

- Multipart uploads, allows you to upload parts of a file concurrently.

- Suggested for files a 100MB over. It is required for any file over 5GBs

- Allows us to resume a stopped file upload

- Eventual consistency. All AZ's (Availability Zones) will eventually be consistent. Put/Write/Delete requests will eventually be consistent across AZ's.

S3 Use Cases

- File shares for networks
- Backup/Archiving
- Origin for CloudFront CDN's (Content Distribution Networks)
- Hosting static files
- Hosting static websites

S3 Static websites

	http://osv-website.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/

	osv-website.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com

		osv-website.		bucket name
		s3-website-			public bucket vs static website (key is s3-website-)
		us-west-2			region
		.amazonaws.com		

S3 CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) If you need to enable an EC2 instance or a S3 website to cross referencing javascript or html5 to another s3 bucket.

	Get the endpoint of the origin bucket
	Go to the destination bucket. Click on permissions then add CORS configuration
	
Lifecycle Management and Glacier

- Lifecycle management policies can be enabled on buckets with or without versioning

CDN Content Delivery Network

- It's a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user,
	the origin of the webpage and a content deliver server.

CloudFront

- It's the Amazon CDN. It can be used to deliver your entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content using a global network of edge locations.
	Requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with the best possible performance.

- Is optimized to work with other Amazon Web services like S3, EC2, ELB and Route53. It also works seamlessly with any non-AWS origin server, which stores
	the original, definitive versions of your files.
	
	Terminology
	
		Origin: This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be either an S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer or Route53
		Distribution: This is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations. You can have one distribution with multiple origins.

	Distribution Types
	
		Web Distribution - Typically used for websites
		RTMP - Used for Media Streaming
		

S3 Transfer Acceleration

	S3 Transfer Acceleration utilises the CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate your uploads to S3.
	Instead of uploading directly to your S3 bucket you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to S3.
	You will get a distinct URL to upload to; acloudguru.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com
