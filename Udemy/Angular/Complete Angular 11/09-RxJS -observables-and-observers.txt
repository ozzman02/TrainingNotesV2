RxJS - Observables and Observers

	What is Observable and Observer?
	
		"Observables and Observer" is a pattern of "message passing" from "publisher" to "subscriber".
		
	Flow of functionality:

		Observable is created.

		Observer subscribes to the Observable.

		Observable can pass messages (notifications) to the Observer.

		Each time, when the Observable passes a notification, it is received by Observer.

	Real-time usage of Observables and Observer:

		While receiving response from AJAX.

		While performing large tasks in client (browser).

		Observables execute only when the observer subscribes to it.

		Observable -> Notifications -> Observer

	How "Observable and Observer" work?

		Observable

			(User Inputs / Http Requests / Custom Data Source)

		Observer

			Handle Data

			Handle Error

			Handle Completion


Introduction to AJAX

	What is AJAX?

		AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And Xml) is NOT a language, but it is a concept, which is used to "send background HTTP request to server" and also "get background HTTP response from server", 
		without refreshing (reloading) the web page in the browser.


	Browser (Client)										Server

		User performs some activity							Receive the request from browser
										--------------->	
		Send AJAX request to server											|
																			|
																			|
																			v
																Do process (db connection)
																			|
																			|
	Same Browser (Client)													|
																			v
		Get response from server		<---------------		Send response to browser														
		Display the response
	

	Types of Requests
		
		Get: 	Used to retrieve / search data from server

		Post: 	Used to insert data to server

		Put: 	Used to update data on server

		Delete: Used to delete data from server


	RxJS - Map
		
		The "Map" is an RXJS Operator, which executes a function after receiving response from the server.

		Server -> Send Response -> [Business logic & modify the response] -> Subscribe -> Handle Data -> [Receive modified response]
