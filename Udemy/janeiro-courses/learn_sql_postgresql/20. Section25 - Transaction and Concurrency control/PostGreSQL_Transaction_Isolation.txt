PostGreSQL Transaction Isolation

    MVCC: Multiversion Concurrency Control

    Data is not overwritten, but changes are timestamped.
    Each statement sees a snapshot based on how the data looked at a given timestamp.
    This prevents conflicts based on locking records during trasaction.


    Default isolation level: READ COMMITTED

    Also READ UNCOMMITTED acts like READ COMMITTED.

    All reads see a snapshot of data before the query began. It does not see any updates within
    it's own transaction, even though they are not committed.
