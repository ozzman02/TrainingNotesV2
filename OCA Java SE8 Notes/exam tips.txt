Exam Tips

- The classes and interfaces can be defined in any order of occurrence in a Java source code file.

- Classes and interfaces defined in the same Java source code file can’t be defined in separate packages. Classes and interfaces imported using the import 
	statement are available to all the classes and interfaces defined in the same Java source code file.
	
- The method parameters that are passed to the main method are also called command-line parameters or command-line values. As the name
	implies, these values are passed to a method from the command line.

- You don’t need an explicit import statement to use members from the java.lang package. Classes and interfaces in this package are automatically
	imported in all other Java classes, interfaces, or enums.

- Members of a named package can’t access classes and interfaces defined in the default package.

- Static imports is a Java feature, but the syntax is import static.
	
- A derived class can inherit and access protected members of its base class, regardless of the package in which it’s defined. 

- A derived class in a separate package can’t access protected members of its base class using reference variables.

- Default access can be compared to package-private (accessible only within a package), and protected access can be compared to 
	package private + kids (“kids” refer to derived classes). Kids can access protected methods only by inheritance and not 
	by reference (accessing members by using the dot operator on an object).

- Watch out for invalid combinations of a Java entity and an access modifier. Such code won’t compile

- An abstract class may or may not define an abstract method. But a concrete class can’t define an abstract method.

- A method with an empty body isn’t an abstract method.

- Don’t be tricked by code that tries to apply the nonaccess modifier abstract to a variable. Such code won’t compile.

- Even though you can use an object reference variable to access static members, it’s not advisable to do so. Because static members belong
	to a class and not to individual objects, using object reference variables to access static members may make them appear to belong to an object. 
	The preferred way to access them is by using the class name. The static and final nonaccess modifiers can be used together to define 
	constants (variables whose value can’t change).

- static methods and variables can’t access the instance members of a class.

- You can access static variables and methods using a null reference.

- In this exam, the questions test your ability to select the best suitable data type for a condition that can only have two states: yes/no or true/
	false. The correct answer here is the boolean type.
	
- In the exam, you won’t be asked to convert a number from the decimal number system to the octal and hexadecimal number systems and
	vice versa. But you can expect questions that ask you to select valid literals for integers.
