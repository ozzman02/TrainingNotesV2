Selected classes from the Java API and arrays

	4.1 Welcome to the world of the String class
		
		4.1.1 Creating String objects
		
			- String objects created using the operator new always refer to separate objects, even if they store the same sequence of characters.
			- String objects created using the assignment operator (=) may refer to the same object if they store the same sequence of characters.
			- You can also create a String object by enclosing a value within double quotes ("): 
				
				System.out.println("Morning"); // Creates a new String object with value Morning in the String constant pool
				
			- Because String objects are immutable, the pool of String objects is also called the String constant pool.
			- You can also invoke other overloaded constructors of the class String to create its objects by using the operator new.
			- You can also create objects of String using the classes StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
			
			Counting string objects
			
				- If a String object is created using the keyword new, it always results in the creation of a new String object. 
				- String objects created this way are never pooled. 
				- When a variable is assigned a String literal using the assignment operator, a new String object is created only if a String object with the
					same value isn’t found in the String constant pool.
					
		4.1.2 The class String is immutable
		
			- Once created, the contents of an object of the class String can never be modified.
			- The immutability of String objects helps the JVM reuse String objects, reducing memory overhead and increasing performance.	
			- The JVM creates a pool of String objects that can be referenced by multiple variables across the JVM.
			- The JVM can make this optimization only because String is immutable.
			- String objects can be shared across multiple reference variables without any fear of changes in their values.
			
			Immutability of the class String:
			
				- String uses a char array to store its value
				- String uses final variable to store its value	
				- Methods of string don’t modify the char array
