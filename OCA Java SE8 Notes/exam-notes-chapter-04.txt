		4.1.1 Creating String objects
		
			- String objects created using the operator new always refer to separate objects, even if they store the same sequence of characters.
			- String objects created using the assignment operator (=) may refer to the same object if they store the same sequence of characters.
			- You can also create a String object by enclosing a value within double quotes ("): 
				
				System.out.println("Morning"); // Creates a new String object with value Morning in the String constant pool
				
			- Because String objects are immutable, the pool of String objects is also called the String constant pool.
			- You can also invoke other overloaded constructors of the class String to create its objects by using the operator new.
			- You can also create objects of String using the classes StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
